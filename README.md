This is the project that I create for visually impaired to know what is the object through live-web camera. This project is still MVP which is planned to develop it furthermore on the future. This repo contain yolov5 from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and another custom trained dataset yolov5 from [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/)

## MVP Program Application
Application that enables live webcam detection using pretrained YOLOv5s weights, see real time inference result of the model, and voice the object named by using [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/).
